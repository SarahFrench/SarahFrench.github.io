This was done in ~June 2020.
I did a little write-up about how I completed this project on the page itself, so take a look at the project here: Fairy Lights on GitHub Pages</description></item><item><title>Advent Calendar 2019</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</guid><description>What on Earth&amp;hellip; This, my friends, was the first &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; project I started and completed as a junior developer. It&amp;rsquo;s a advent calendar for 2019 which allowed the user (my boyfriend) to open up a new page each day between December 1st-25th, and each day is a little nugget of madness.
By having 25 advent pages to fill, this project gave me the opportunity to try a ton of new things and helped me learn SO MUCH about frontend development and browser APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
