It&amp;rsquo;s a advent calendar for 2019 which allowed the user (my boyfriend) to open up a new page each day between December 1st-25th, and each day is a little nugget of madness.
By having 25 advent pages to fill, this project gave me the opportunity to try a ton of new things and helped me learn SO MUCH about frontend development and browser APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
