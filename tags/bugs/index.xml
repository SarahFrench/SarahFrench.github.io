Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wary of working with data that relies heavily on dates. (If you cannot tell, this paragraph&amp;rsquo;s job is to supply foreshadowing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent project at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting Covid-19 data from various government sources and consolidating them into one standardised collection. The best scenario is that a country&amp;rsquo;s government has a well-documented API. Typically countries seem to publish daily PDFs or CSVs that keep having data appended to the bottom. The worst-case was a certain health ministry&amp;rsquo;s website that would include yesterdays data in the homepage&amp;rsquo;s HTML and then update the HTML the next day with the previous day&amp;rsquo;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
