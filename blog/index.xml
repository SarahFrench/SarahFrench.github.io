Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that print statements and logs only get you so far, and &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; debugging is so much more useful. When I first started contributing to Terraform provider projects I wasn&amp;rsquo;t shown how to use debuggers with providers and the resources I found online were a bit fragmented. So, this blog is a way for me to share what I learned and hopefully help others (or just be a reference for myself in the future!).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using Terraform Providers: Dodging Default Behaviour</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="contents"&gt;Contents&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Terraform regularly for a while now and decided to consolidate my knowledge by studying for the &lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/certification/terraform-associate"&gt;Terraform Associate Certification&lt;/a&gt;. I hoped this would identify gaps in my knowledge, as I&amp;rsquo;ve found that feeling like you&amp;rsquo;ve learned &amp;rsquo;enough&amp;rsquo; is an easy trap to fall into when learning a new technology. You get comfortable with your incomplete-but-sufficient mental models of how things work and don&amp;rsquo;t know what you don&amp;rsquo;t know, until you encounter a bug that makes zero sense to you. Or you never realise there&amp;rsquo;s a gap and you totally miss out on features!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>When is a leap year not a leap year? Don't ask Microsoft Excel</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-02-27-leap-year-excel-error/</link><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2021 13:35:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-02-27-leap-year-excel-error/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dates and times always have the potential to cause trouble in code; back in my apprenticeship, my teacher drove this point home by sharing a great article called &lt;a href="https://infiniteundo.com/post/25326999628/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-time" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;Falsehoods programmers believe about time&lt;/a&gt;. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wary of working with data that relies heavily on dates. (If you cannot tell, this paragraph&amp;rsquo;s job is to supply foreshadowing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent project at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting Covid-19 data from various government sources and consolidating them into one standardised collection. The best scenario is that a country&amp;rsquo;s government has a well-documented API. Typically countries seem to publish daily PDFs or CSVs that keep having data appended to the bottom. The worst-case was a certain health ministry&amp;rsquo;s website that would include yesterdays data in the homepage&amp;rsquo;s HTML and then update the HTML the next day with the previous day&amp;rsquo;s stats.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Hello World : Looking back on 2020</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="hello"&gt;Hello!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this, welcome! You are probably one of my parents, my partner, or someone procrastinating by reading what will arguably be the worst blog post I write. But that is the point– I want to start blogging about tech and working as a developer to improve my writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ease me into regular writing, and as a way to describe my background a little, here&amp;rsquo;s a little recap of my achievements in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
