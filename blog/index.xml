Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that print statements and logs only get you so far, and proper debugging is so much more useful. When I first started contributing to Terraform provider projects I wasn&amp;rsquo;t shown how to use debuggers with providers and the resources I found online were a bit fragmented. So, this blog is a way for me to share what I learned and hopefully help others (or just be a reference for myself in the future!</description></item><item><title>Using Terraform Providers: Dodging Default Behaviour</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</guid><description>Contents Intro Providers: what are they?

Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wary of working with data that relies heavily on dates. (If you cannot tell, this paragraph&amp;rsquo;s job is to supply foreshadowing).
In a recent project at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting Covid-19 data from various government sources and consolidating them into one standardised collection.</description></item><item><title>Hello World : Looking back on 2020</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</guid><description>Hello!
