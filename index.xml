I&amp;rsquo;d reduced the problem down to just trying to get the background colour be red when the page was &amp;lt;700px wide when using the responsive preview developer tool in Chrome and it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t working, unless I made the max width much larger. Then a vague memory of &amp;ldquo;viewports&amp;rdquo; entered my mind&amp;hellip;
tl;dr add this to the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; of your HTML and bear in mind viewports don&amp;rsquo;t always match the dimensions you&amp;rsquo;re presented as a viewer!</description></item><item><title>How to debug dependencies in Go projects</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/memo/2024-06-19-debugging-dependencies/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/memo/2024-06-19-debugging-dependencies/</guid><description>Debugging dependencies If you want to debug how a dependency is used in a Go project run go mod vendor to download all your projects dependencies to a vendor folder in your project. You can then add breakpoints to the vendored code just like your project code.
Replacing dependencies with your forks If you&amp;rsquo;re working on a contribution to a dependency (for example fixing a bug you&amp;rsquo;ve discovered) then you might want to test that out locally with your project.</description></item><item><title>Why static assets might 404 unexpectedly in Hugo projects</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/memo/2024-06-02-hugo-image-assets/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/memo/2024-06-02-hugo-image-assets/</guid><description>If you want to reference an image in the content of a Hugo website you cannot just add a new image to the static folder and hardcode the image&amp;rsquo;s src in markdown. Hugo will only include assets if they are used in Hugo templating, like {{ $go := resources.Get &amp;quot;image/go.jpeg&amp;quot; }}.</description></item><item><title>Debugging Terraform providers with VS Code</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2024-05-28-debugging-terraform-providers-with-vscode/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2024-05-28-debugging-terraform-providers-with-vscode/</guid><description>My first experience of &amp;lsquo;debugging&amp;rsquo; was using good old console.log in JavaScript when I was first learning about programming. Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve learned that print statements and logs only get you so far, and proper debugging is so much more useful. When I first started contributing to Terraform provider projects I wasn&amp;rsquo;t shown how to use debuggers with providers and the resources I found online were a bit fragmented. So, this blog is a way for me to share what I learned and hopefully help others (or just be a reference for myself in the future!</description></item><item><title>Using Terraform Providers: Dodging Default Behaviour</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2022-09-11-terraform-dodging-defaults/</guid><description>Contents Intro Providers: what are they?

Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wary of working with data that relies heavily on dates. (If you cannot tell, this paragraph&amp;rsquo;s job is to supply foreshadowing).
In a recent project at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting Covid-19 data from various government sources and consolidating them into one standardised collection.</description></item><item><title>Hello World : Looking back on 2020</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</guid><description>Hello! If you are reading this, welcome! You are probably one of my parents, my partner, or someone procrastinating by reading what will arguably be the worst blog post I write. But that is the pointâ€“ I want to start blogging about tech and working as a developer to improve my writing.
To ease me into regular writing, and as a way to describe my background a little, here&amp;rsquo;s a little recap of my achievements in 2020.</description></item><item><title>Fairy Lights</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2020-06-01-fairy-lights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2020-06-01-fairy-lights/</guid><description>This project was one of my earliest experiments with drawing vector images in illustration software and using them in a frontend project. This was done in ~June 2020.
I did a little write-up about how I completed this project on the page itself, so take a look at the project here: Fairy Lights on GitHub Pages</description></item><item><title>Conway's Game of Life</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-11-28-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-11-28-game-of-life/</guid><description>When? ~ November 2019
Where? Hosted React visualisation of the project
Code on GitHub
What? This project is an implementation of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life, a &amp;lsquo;game&amp;rsquo; that shows how a grid of cells that are either are alive or dead changes over time given: 1) a starting state of mixed cells, and 2) rule that define how a cells neighbours affects its status.
At the time I did this I was still doing my software development apprenticeship and only just learning about test-driven development.</description></item><item><title>Advent Calendar 2019</title><link>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://sarahfrench.dev/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</guid><description>Note: With the end of Heroku's Free Tier came the end of this project :'( , however I've copied some of the static pages over to https://sarahfrench.dev/silly-pages
What on Earth&amp;hellip; This, my friends, was the first &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; project I started and completed as a junior developer. It&amp;rsquo;s a advent calendar for 2019 which allowed the user (my boyfriend) to open up a new page each day between December 1st-25th, and each day is a little nugget of madness.</description></item></channel></rss>
