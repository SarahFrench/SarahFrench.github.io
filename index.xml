Since then I&amp;rsquo;ve been wary of working with data that relies heavily on dates. (If you cannot tell, this paragraph&amp;rsquo;s job is to supply foreshadowing).
In a recent project at work, I&amp;rsquo;ve been collecting Covid-19 data from various government sources and consolidating them into one standardised collection.</description></item><item><title>Hello World : Looking back on 2020</title><link>http://localhost:1313/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2021 15:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/blog/2021-01-03-my-first-post/</guid><description>Hello! If you are reading this, welcome! You are probably one of my parents, my partner, or someone procrastinating by reading what will arguably be the worst blog post I write. But that is the pointâ€“ I want to start blogging about tech and working as a developer to improve my writing.
To ease me into regular writing, and as a way to describe my background a little, here&amp;rsquo;s a little recap of my achievements in 2020.</description></item><item><title>Fairy Lights</title><link>http://localhost:1313/project/2020-06-01-fairy-lights/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/project/2020-06-01-fairy-lights/</guid><description>This project was one of my earliest experiments with drawing vector images in illustration software and using them in a frontend project. This was done in ~June 2020.
I did a little write-up about how I completed this project on the page itself, so take a look at the project here: Fairy Lights on GitHub Pages</description></item><item><title>Conway's Game of Life</title><link>http://localhost:1313/project/2019-11-28-game-of-life/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/project/2019-11-28-game-of-life/</guid><description>When? ~ November 2019
Where? Hosted React visualisation of the project
Code on GitHub
What? This project is an implementation of Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life, a &amp;lsquo;game&amp;rsquo; that shows how a grid of cells that are either are alive or dead changes over time given: 1) a starting state of mixed cells, and 2) rule that define how a cells neighbours affects its status.
At the time I did this I was still doing my software development apprenticeship and only just learning about test-driven development.</description></item><item><title>Advent Calendar 2019</title><link>http://localhost:1313/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/project/2019-08-27-advent-calendar/</guid><description>What on Earth&amp;hellip; This, my friends, was the first &amp;lsquo;big&amp;rsquo; project I started and completed as a junior developer. It&amp;rsquo;s a advent calendar for 2019 which allowed the user (my boyfriend) to open up a new page each day between December 1st-25th, and each day is a little nugget of madness.
By having 25 advent pages to fill, this project gave me the opportunity to try a ton of new things and helped me learn SO MUCH about frontend development and browser APIs.</description></item></channel></rss>
