## Debugging dependencies

If you want to debug how a dependency is used in a Go project run `go mod vendor` to download all your projects dependencies to a `vendor` folder in your project. You can then add breakpoints to the vendored code just like your project code.


## Replacing dependencies with your forks

If you're working on a contribution to a dependency (for example fixing a bug you've discovered) then you might want to test that out locally with your project. To do this you can use the `replace` keyword in your go.mod file. Here I've replaced use of `hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk` with my fork, specifically a commit containing an idea for a contribution/bug fix ([d188bcc](https://github.com/SarahFrench/terraform-plugin-sdk/commit/d188bcc3c75e66bd775b98fc512a5706ccf930e8)).

```
module github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google-beta

go 1.21

require (
  ...
	github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 v2.33.0
  ...
)

// Use my fork of the hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk repository instead
replace github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 => github.com/SarahFrench/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 d188bcc3c75e66bd775b98fc512a5706ccf930e8
```

After a quick `go mod tidy` this is changed to a valid reference, which in my case seems to take advantage of exissting tags in the repository; your milage may vary:

```diff
- replace github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 => github.com/SarahFrench/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 d188bcc3c75e66bd775b98fc512a5706ccf930e8
+ replace github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 => github.com/SarahFrench/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 v2.34.1-0.20240619163930-d188bcc3c75e
```

## Debugging the replaced dependencies

After adding `replace` to your go.mod file you can run `go mod vendor` again. In the vendor folder the directory structure will use the replaced dependency's name (vendor/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/... in my case) but the actual code inside will be the contents of your fork!

Using these steps I was able to find my contribution's regex needed to be [updated to account for a suffix present on sweeper names](https://github.com/SarahFrench/terraform-plugin-sdk/commit/8de2d85fb5cb52931e835c9bfe848737a492ecf0), which is used internally by the SDK code.
