This project was one of my earliest experiments with drawing vector images in illustration software and using them in a frontend project. This was done in ~June 2020.

I did a little write-up about how I completed this project on the page itself, so take a look at the project here: <a href="https://sarahfrench.github.io/fairy-lights/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Fairy Lights on GitHub Pages</a>
